# CreditCardFraudDetection
# Project Name- Credit Card Fraud Detection
# Abstract
This project aims to build a system for detection.
The project detects the fraudulent and normal transactions so that the customers can not charged for the items that have not purchased.
# What I have done?
I have taken the dataset from kaggle. 
I have used some methods to deal with imbalance so that the model can respond fast.
Now, I have plotted the correlation matrix and divided the dataset into test dataset and train dataset.
Prediction is done by Random forest model and all evaluating parameters and confusion matrix is built.
# How I have done?
Loaded the dataset. 
Reduced imbalance in the dataset.
Plotted the correlation matrix as it gives us an idea of how features correlate with each other.
Divided the dataset into two main groups i.e. one for training and other for testing.
Built a Random forest model and all evaluating parameters and confusion matrix.
# Result achieved
Fraudulent transaction and normal transaction have been classified.

Accuracy = 0.9995,
Precision = 0.9342,
Recall score = 0.771,
F1 score = 0.8452
